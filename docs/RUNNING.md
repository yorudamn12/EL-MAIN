# Running the experiment on your GPU (RTX 4060 Laptop, 8 GB)

## 0. One-time setup (native Windows, PowerShell)
No WSL needed: torch (CUDA build) and bitsandbytes 4-bit both run natively on Windows.

Install first: the NVIDIA driver, Git for Windows, Python 3.11 (python.org, tick "Add to PATH").
Clone **outside OneDrive-synced folders** (sync tools can lock the SQLite files).

```powershell
git config --global core.longpaths true
git clone https://github.com/yorudamn12/EL-MAIN C:\dev\EL-MAIN
cd C:\dev\EL-MAIN
git checkout claude/wonderful-hypatia-pqs6t9
python -m venv .venv
# If activation is blocked: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128   # CUDA build of torch
pip install -e ".[dev,api,ml]"
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
python -m pytest -q                                 # should all pass
huggingface-cli login                               # only for the gated Llama / Gemma models
```
Never put Hugging Face tokens in configs or commits. Optional: set `HF_HOME` to a drive with ~20 GB free.

Linux (bash) is the same with `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`.

**Letting Claude drive the GPU directly:** open this folder in Claude Code on the laptop; that session can use the GPU.

## 1a. One pipeline, one command (B4)
Every stage from the baseline benchmark to the comparison, in the foreground (the worker for queued jobs comes in B5).
Each job gets its own folder `runs/pipelines/<job id>/`. **Explore runs are never paper evidence.**
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.jobs run --preset explore --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --limit 50
python -m dreammachine.jobs run --kind benchmark_run --model Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B --limit 300          # baseline + diagnosis only
python -m dreammachine.jobs run --preset explore --model Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B --target feature:n_carry --reuse-from <job id>
python -m dreammachine.jobs run --preset paper --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B                             # the full protocol (days)
```
`--reuse-from` skips the baseline (and the diagnosis, if its settings match) of an earlier explore pipeline or benchmark
run. Explore defaults: `configs/explore.yaml` (starting guesses until B8 measures them).

**Queue + worker (B5)** — queue jobs, and let one worker run them in the background (one step per subprocess,
so GPU memory is freed after every step):
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.jobs enqueue --preset explore --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --limit 50
python -m dreammachine.jobs.worker                  # keep this window open; Ctrl+C stops it (the running step fails
                                                    # as "interrupted" and can be resumed)
python -m dreammachine.jobs list
python -m dreammachine.jobs show <job id>
python -m dreammachine.jobs cancel <job id>         # stops at the next safe point; force-killed after 120 s
python -m dreammachine.jobs resume <job id>         # failed/cancelled -> queued; finished steps are kept
python -m dreammachine.jobs delete <job id>         # explore jobs only, not while queued/running
```
**Results (B6):** the last step writes `runs/pipelines/<job id>/results.json` (the API's `PipelineResults`) and a
readable `report.md`: baseline, the primary result (targeted − matched control; "proposed" until the team confirms
D8), each arm vs the untrained model with regressions, arm vs arm, change in η (negative = the feature hurts less),
error-type shift, and provenance. Paper runs are flagged `paper_eligible` only if every step finished, nothing was
overridden and the git working tree was clean when the run started — commit before starting a paper run.

Logs: `runs/pipelines/<job id>/logs/job.log`; GPU readings every 30 s: `logs/gpu.csv` (temperature, SM clock, power,
utilisation, memory), summarised per step. Only one worker can run at a time.

## 1. Smoke run (proves your setup works end to end)
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run screen     --config configs/smoke.yaml
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run diagnose   --config configs/smoke.yaml
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run build-data --config configs/smoke.yaml
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run train      --config configs/smoke.yaml --arm targeted --ratio 3 --seed 0
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run evaluate   --config configs/smoke.yaml --arm base
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run evaluate   --config configs/smoke.yaml --arm targeted --ratio 3 --seed 0
python -m dreammachine.experiments.run report     --config configs/smoke.yaml
```

## 2. Main experiment (`configs/main.yaml`)
| Stage | Command | Rough cost on a 4060 | Human checkpoint |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen | `run screen` | ~1–2 h for 4 models | Pick `model` from `runs/main/screen.json`, then CONFIRM it in COMPONENTS.md |
| Diagnose | `run diagnose` | ~1–2 h | Annotate `runs/main/annotate_errors.csv` (2 people, blind), compute κ, CONFIRM the target factor |
| Build data | `run build-data` | minutes (CPU) | Check `data/manifest.json`: equal tokens per arm, match KS small |
| Train | `run train --all` | 18 trainings × ~30–60 min | — |
| Evaluate | `run evaluate --arm base` then `run evaluate --all` | ~20–40 min per evaluation | — |
| Report | `run report` | seconds | Read `runs/main/report.md` |

`--all` = per seed `real_only_r0` + `untargeted_r3` + `matched_control_r3` + `targeted_r1/r3/r9` = 6, × 3 seeds = 18
trainings and 18 evaluations (plus the base evaluation).
Estimates are [Guessing]-grade until the smoke run gives real throughput numbers (section 6).

**If you run out of memory:** lower `generation.batch_size` (inference), or lower
`train.per_device_batch_size` to 2 and raise `grad_accum` to 8 (same effective batch).
Training resumes from the last checkpoint if interrupted: rerun the same command.

**4-bit:** `train.load_in_4bit: true` (QLoRA) needs bitsandbytes with CUDA. If it cannot run, the step stops
with a clear error; there is no silent fallback. Models up to ~1.7B also fit in bf16 with `load_in_4bit: false`.

## 3. The human-validation step (the 150 errors)
1. Hide the `classifier_label` column. Two teammates fill `annotator_1` / `annotator_2`
   independently, using the labels FORMAT_ERROR, ARITHMETIC_SLIP, DISTRACTOR_USE, PLAN_ERROR,
   UNVERIFIABLE.
2. Then compute agreement:
```python
import csv
from dreammachine.diagnosis import cohen_kappa
rows = list(csv.DictReader(open("runs/main/annotate_errors.csv", encoding="utf-8")))
print("human-human", cohen_kappa([r["annotator_1"] for r in rows], [r["annotator_2"] for r in rows]))
print("classifier-human", cohen_kappa([r["classifier_label"] for r in rows], [r["annotator_1"] for r in rows]))
```
κ ≥ 0.6 between the classifier and humans is the usual bar for "substantial" agreement.

## 4. Offline datasets
If Hugging Face is unreachable, export once elsewhere and point the config at the files:
```yaml
eval_data:
  gsm8k_test: data/gsm8k_test.jsonl
  gsm8k_train: data/gsm8k_train.jsonl
  gsm_symbolic_p1: data/gsm_symbolic_p1.jsonl
```
(The format is `Example` rows: see `dreammachine.data.save_jsonl`.)

## 5. API (B7) — what the frontend talks to
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.serve                    # API on http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1 + the worker; Ctrl+C stops both
python -m dreammachine.serve --no-worker        # API only (run `python -m dreammachine.jobs.worker` yourself)
# interactive docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
python -m dreammachine.api.export_openapi       # after any route/shape change -> docs/openapi.json
```
The API is exactly `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` (version 0.2.0). It listens on 127.0.0.1 only and has no authentication:
never expose it to a network. CORS allows the dev servers on ports 5173 and 3000 (override with
`$env:DREAMMACHINE_CORS_ORIGINS = "http://localhost:5173,..."`).

## 6. Measured numbers (RTX 4060 Laptop, 8 GB) — GPU-verified, B1 smoke run, 2026-10-04
Setup: native Windows 11, Python 3.11.9, torch 2.11.0+cu128, transformers 5.18.0, peft 0.21.2,
bitsandbytes 0.50.2, driver 581.29, on AC power, "Balanced" power plan. Model `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`, `configs/smoke.yaml`
(eval in bf16, `max_new_tokens: 256`, `batch_size: 16`; training 4-bit QLoRA, batch 4, 30 steps).
One measurement on one laptop: treat as a rough guide, not a benchmark.

| Stage | Wall time | Model load | Work | Throughput | Peak VRAM (allocated / reserved) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| screen (66 problems, greedy) | 200 s | 18.8 s | 177 s | 0.37 problems/s | 2.0 / 2.3 GB |
| diagnose (216 probes × 2 samples, T=0.7) | 570 s | 15.5 s | 554 s | 0.39 problems/s = 0.78 answers/s | 2.9 / 3.3 GB |
| build-data (CPU) | 12 s | — | — | — | — |
| train targeted_r3_s0 (4-bit QLoRA, 30 steps) | 80 s | ~25 s (load + tokenise + save) | 54.6 s | **1.82 s/step**, 2.2 samples/s | 4.0 / 6.7 GB |
| evaluate base (82 problems) | 242 s | 13.9 s | 223 s | 0.35–0.42 problems/s | 2.0 / 2.3 GB |
| evaluate targeted (base + LoRA adapter) | 338 s | 19.3 s | 309 s | 0.22–0.54 problems/s | 2.0 / 2.4 GB |
| report | < 5 s | — | — | — | — |

- **Whole smoke run:** ~24 min. Disk: 109 MB under `runs/smoke/` (adapter 49.5 MB, `checkpoint-30` 58.6 MB,
  data 0.4 MB) + 0.7 MB SQLite. Device memory seen by `nvidia-smi` peaked at 7.5 GB of 8 GB (during training, incl.
  other processes).
- **Thermals:** max GPU temperature 62 °C; SM clock while busy min 210 / mean 1193 / max 2655 MHz; mean power 19.5 W
  (max 54 W). No HW thermal or power-brake slowdown was recorded.
- **Inference is CPU-bound, not GPU-bound:** mean GPU utilisation while generating was only ~34 %. With a 0.6B model,
  Hugging Face `generate` spends most of each token step in Python/kernel-launch overhead, so larger
  `generation.batch_size` (e.g. 32–64) should raise throughput almost linearly at small VRAM cost — not yet measured.
- **Token limit and batch size (measured after B1, dev slice = last 200 GSM8K *train* items, Qwen3-0.6B, dm_v1,
  greedy, bf16):**

  | max_new_tokens | batch_size | accuracy | answers cut off | problems/s | peak VRAM |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 256 | 16 | 0.495 | 17.5 % | 0.40 | 2.0 GB |
  | 512 | 16 | 0.560 | 0.5 % | 0.29 | 2.4 GB |
  | **512** | **32** | **0.565** | **0 %** | **0.52** | 3.5 GB |

  The configs now use 512 / 32. `batch_size` counts generated sequences (questions × `n_samples`), so the
  diagnose stage (2–3 samples per question) stays within the same memory. Each answer records `truncated`
  (hit the token limit); evaluation metrics include `<benchmark>:truncated_share`.
- **Batch 64 does not fit:** at 512 tokens it filled 7.75 of 8.19 GB and was still unfinished after 26 min
  (batch 32: 6.5 min). See "GPU memory spill" below.
- **Extrapolation (a guess, not measured):** at ~0.4 problems/s, the full GSM8K test (1319) takes ~55 min per model
  evaluation at 256 new tokens, longer at 700.
- Smoke config gap: the eval grid has `steps ∈ {2, 4}`, so with the smoke target `steps` (threshold 4.0) the
  "above threshold" slice is empty (`accuracy: null`). Plumbing only; the main config's grid covers it.

## 7. Accuracy exploration: models, prompts, decoding — GPU-verified, EXPLORE ONLY (2026-10-04/05)
**Not paper evidence.** Run with throwaway scripts (kept in `runs/dev_explore/`, git-ignored), no provenance.
For the paper's settings-selection table, re-run through the benchmark module (B2/B8) with provenance.

Dev set: the last 200 GSM8K **train** problems (never GSM8K test). Scored with the repo's own
`classify` / `extract_answer`. bf16, RTX 4060 Laptop, native Windows. "Boxed" = the prompt recommended in the
Qwen3 model card (Best Practices): *"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}."*
appended to the question in the user turn. Thinking mode uses the model card's sampling (T=0.6, top-p 0.95,
top-k 20; greedy is discouraged there). Majority vote = 5 samples at T=0.7, top-p 0.8, top-k 20.

| Model | Prompt | Decoding | Accuracy | Cut off | Mean tokens | Time / 200 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B | dm_v1 | greedy, 512 tok | 0.565 | 0 % | 191 | 6 min |
| Qwen3-0.6B | **boxed** | greedy, 512 tok | **0.705** | 2 % | 254 | 8 min |
| Qwen3-0.6B | dm_v1 | thinking, 2048 tok | 0.590 | 14 % | 934 | 120 min |
| Qwen3-0.6B | boxed | thinking, 2048 tok | 0.720 | 27.5 % | 1325 | 129 min |
| Qwen3-0.6B | dm_v1 | majority of 5, 512 tok | 0.635 | 0.5 % | 193 | 37 min |
| Qwen3-1.7B | dm_v1 | greedy, 512 tok | 0.790 | 1.5 % | 242 | 11 min |
| Qwen3-1.7B | **boxed** | greedy, 512 tok | **0.860** | 2.5 % | 293 | 13 min |
| Qwen3-1.7B | dm_v1 | thinking, 2048 tok | 0.840 | 16 % | 1031 | 224 min |
| Qwen3-1.7B | boxed | thinking, 2048 tok | 0.785 | 31.5 % | 1540 | 266 min |
| Qwen3-1.7B | dm_v1 | majority of 5, 512 tok | 0.840 | 2 % | 241 | 67 min |

Paired bootstrap on the same 200 problems (difference, 95% CI):
- boxed − dm_v1 (greedy): 0.6B **+0.140** [+0.075, +0.205]; 1.7B **+0.070** [+0.015, +0.125].
- 1.7B − 0.6B (greedy): dm_v1 +0.225 [+0.155, +0.295]; boxed +0.155 [+0.090, +0.225].
- thinking − greedy: 0.6B dm_v1 +0.025 [−0.055, +0.105]; 0.6B boxed +0.015 [−0.055, +0.085];
  1.7B dm_v1 +0.050 [−0.015, +0.115]; 1.7B boxed **−0.075** [−0.135, −0.015] (31.5 % of answers hit the limit).
- majority-of-5 − greedy (dm_v1): 0.6B +0.070 [+0.015, +0.125]; 1.7B +0.050 [+0.015, +0.085].
- boxed greedy − dm_v1 majority-of-5: 0.6B +0.070 [+0.005, +0.135]; 1.7B +0.020 [−0.030, +0.070].

Reading (for the team to decide; nothing in the configs was changed for this):
- **The boxed prompt is the biggest cheap gain** on both models, at ~1.2–1.3× the time of dm_v1.
- **Thinking mode is not worth it here:** no significant gain anywhere, a loss on 1.7B + boxed, ~15–20× the
  time, and the error classifier cannot see the stripped thinking text.
- **Majority voting helps dm_v1 but costs 5×**, and boxed greedy is as good or better.
- Switching the project prompt to "boxed" is a D10 decision: training completions would then end with
  `\boxed{n}` instead of `#### n`, and dm_v1's request to write every calculation as an equation (which the
  error classifier relies on) would be gone. UNVERIFIABLE shares did not rise with boxed in these runs.
- Model choice (open question 3): 1.7B is more accurate but leaves fewer errors to diagnose and fix.

## 8. GPU memory spill on Windows (measured)
When a batch needs more than the 8 GB of dedicated VRAM, Windows does **not** raise out-of-memory: it moves the
overflow into shared system RAM and the run becomes many times slower (seen: thinking mode, Qwen3-0.6B, batch 16,
2048 tokens → 4.3 GB in shared memory, no result after ~2 h; batch 64 at 512 tokens likewise). Check with
`Get-Counter '\GPU Process Memory(*)\Shared Usage'`. Remedies used here: smaller batches (thinking: 0.6B batch 8,
1.7B batch 4, both stayed in VRAM) and `torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(0.92)` so an oversized batch
fails with a clear OOM instead. Proposed for B4/B5: the same cap in step subprocesses, so a pipeline step fails fast
rather than crawling. (Alternative: NVIDIA Control Panel → "CUDA - Sysmem Fallback Policy" → "Prefer No Sysmem
Fallback"; a system setting for the user.)

## 9. B8: first real end-to-end pipeline — GPU-verified, EXPLORE (not paper evidence), 2026-10-05
Started through the API (`POST /api/v1/pipelines`), run by the worker, read back through the API.
Qwen3-0.6B, project prompt `qwen_boxed`, `benchmark_limit` 50, arms targeted + matched_control at ratio 3, seed 0,
explore preset (`configs/explore.yaml`). Job `5a584e16390b`.

| Step | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| preflight | 10 s | |
| baseline | 10 min | 4 benchmarks x 50; 15 s of it model loading |
| diagnose | 60 min | 432 probes x 3 samples; max 73 °C |
| choose_target | <1 s | auto -> `steps` (threshold 4.0) |
| build_data | 30 s | failed once, fixed, resumed (below) |
| train matched_control / targeted | 34 / 29 min | 314 / 262 steps, ~6.6 s/step |
| evaluate matched_control / targeted | 10 / 15 min | |
| **whole pipeline** | **~2.6 h** + 4 min lost to the build_data failure | output folder 107 MB |

Diagnosis (432 items x 3): significant weaknesses `steps` (η +0.53), `n_div` (+1.29), `n_mul` (+0.39); not
significant: `log10_max`, `n_distractors`, `n_carry`. McFadden R² 0.26.

Results (50 problems per benchmark, ONE seed — far too small to conclude anything):

| | GSM8K | probes train families | probes held-out families | η change `steps` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| untrained | 0.62 | 0.38 | 0.32 | — |
| matched_control | 0.30 (regression) | 0.76 | 0.68 | −0.28 |
| targeted | 0.36 (regression) | 0.66 | 0.60 | −1.19 |
| targeted − matched (primary) | +0.06 [−0.06, +0.18] | −0.10 [−0.24, +0.04] | −0.08 [−0.22, +0.06] | |

**Found by this run and fixed (B8):**
1. **Matched control could not fill the equal token budget.** It takes one item per targeted item, but with target
   `steps` its items are much shorter (70 vs 118 whitespace tokens), so it had 127,945 of 150,000 synthetic tokens.
   Fix: the number of items to select is sized by the shorter side's mean length (`synthetic_need`), and the
   candidate pool grows deterministically up to `data.pool_max` (default 4x `pool_size`) when the difficulty band is
   short; a still-impossible budget fails with an actionable message. Matching itself (1:1, nearest predicted logit)
   is unchanged. After the fix both arms reached 199.9k of 200k tokens; 2,772 of 2,772 targeted items were matched
   (mean |Δlogit| 0.01, KS 0.042, p = 0.014 — very close, but with this many items even a small difference is
   detectable: relevant to open question 2, match-quality thresholds).
2. **GSM-Symbolic limits covered only a few templates.** The dataset groups its rows by template (~50 instances
   each), so the first 50 rows were 50 copies of ONE problem (gold answer always 20) and `main.yaml`'s first 500 were
   10 of 100 templates. Fix: a limit now takes instances round-robin across templates (50 -> 50 templates; 500 -> all
   100 x 5); the benchmark version is now 2 and is part of the baseline hash, so old baselines are not reused.
   **The GSM-Symbolic numbers of this run are invalid** (and the targeted arm was evaluated after the fix, so its
   GSM-Symbolic set differs from the baseline's).

**For the team (not fixed — a research decision):** both trained arms got significantly WORSE on GSM8K (−0.26 and
−0.32, whole CI below 0), as in the B1 smoke run. After training, the model writes short GSM8K-style solutions
(the training completions' style) and makes more plan errors. Options to test on the dev set before a paper run:
lower learning rate (2e-4 now) or 1 epoch; more real data (lower ratio); keeping the model's own solution style
(self-distillation — LLM-written data, needs the team's explicit OK). The arm-vs-arm comparison is still valid
(all arms share the setup), but a regression on GSM8K weakens the paper's story.

### Prompt comparison (PLAN.md §8.5) — GPU-verified, B8
Same 200 problems (the GSM8K-**train** dev slice, items 7273-7472; GSM8K test stays untouched), 700 new tokens, greedy,
bf16, the same settings for every prompt (batch 32 for 0.6B, 16 for 1.7B). Shares are of all 200 answers.
`python -m dreammachine.benchmarks run ... --benchmark jsonl:runs/b8/dev200.jsonl --prompt-version <v> --max-new-tokens 700`

| Model | Prompt | Accuracy | FORMAT_ERROR | UNVERIFIABLE | format_ok | Cut off |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-0.6B | dm_v1 | 0.565 | 0.5 % | 13.5 % | 1.5 % | 0 % |
| Qwen3-0.6B | v2_700 | 0.360 | 0.5 % | 42.0 % | 2.5 % | 0 % |
| Qwen3-0.6B | **qwen_boxed** | **0.705** | 0.0 % | 11.0 % | 0.0 % | 0 % |
| Qwen3-1.7B | dm_v1 | 0.790 | 1.0 % | 3.5 % | 20.5 % | 0 % |
| Qwen3-1.7B | v2_700 | 0.775 | 1.0 % | 4.0 % | 11.5 % | 0 % |
| Qwen3-1.7B | **qwen_boxed** | **0.860** | 0.5 % | 2.5 % | 0.0 % | 0.5 % |

Paired (same problems): qwen_boxed − dm_v1 = +0.140 [+0.075, +0.205] (0.6B), +0.070 [+0.015, +0.125] (1.7B);
qwen_boxed − v2_700 = +0.345 [+0.265, +0.425] (0.6B), +0.085 [+0.035, +0.140] (1.7B).
Reading: the project prompt (D10) is best on both models and has the fewest UNVERIFIABLE errors, so the error
classifier keeps finding equations to check. v2_700 asks for no written work: on 0.6B, 42 % of answers become
UNVERIFIABLE and accuracy falls to 0.36. `format_ok` (a bare final number) stays low for every prompt; with
qwen_boxed it is 0 by design (the answer is in `\boxed{}`, which `extract_answer` reads). 700 tokens cut off at most
0.5 % of answers, and 0.6B accuracies equal the 512-token dev runs exactly (§7), so 512 tokens stays the setting.

## 10. Dev-set tuning of the training settings — GPU-verified, EXPLORE (not paper evidence), 2026-10-06
`python -m dreammachine.experiments.tune --config configs/tune.yaml` (PLAN.md §14 question 7). Qwen3-0.6B, project
prompt, B8 diagnosis (target `steps`, threshold 4.0), token budget 200k, one seed. Dev set = the last 200 GSM8K
**train** problems, removed from the training data (`data.dev_holdout: 200`); GSM8K test was not used. Plus 100
held-out probe problems. Each variant took ~29 min to train (1 epoch: 15 min) and ~10 min to evaluate.

| Variant | GSM8K dev (base 0.705) | Δ vs base [95% CI] | held-out probes (base 0.31) | target slice above (base 0.10) | answer length (base 748 chars) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| targeted, lr 2e-4, 2 epochs, ratio 3 (B8 settings) | 0.480 | −0.225 [−0.300, −0.150] | 0.53 (+0.22) | 0.43 | 325 |
| targeted, lr 5e-5 | 0.470 | −0.235 [−0.315, −0.155] | 0.56 (+0.25) | 0.45 | 306 |
| targeted, lr 1e-4, 1 epoch | 0.465 | −0.240 [−0.320, −0.165] | 0.50 (+0.19) | 0.41 | 317 |
| targeted, ratio 1 (more real data) | 0.505 | −0.200 [−0.275, −0.125] | 0.54 (+0.23) | 0.53 | 300 |
| **real_only** (no synthetic data) | 0.480 | −0.225 [−0.295, −0.155] | 0.17 (−0.14) | 0.08 | 305 |

**Findings**
1. **The GSM8K regression is not a hyper-parameter problem.** Learning rate (4x lower), half the epochs and more real
   data all stay at −0.20 to −0.24 (overlapping CIs).
2. **It is not caused by the synthetic data:** training on real GSM8K problems only regresses just as much.
3. **The cause is the completion style.** Every fine-tuned model writes answers ~2.4x shorter (≈300 vs 748 chars),
   copying the terse style of the training solutions (GSM8K's reference solutions and our code-written ones), and
   loses part of its own step-by-step reasoning. (Side effect: far fewer UNVERIFIABLE errors — trained models write
   equations — 0.37 → ~0.10-0.18 of wrong answers.)
4. **The synthetic data does what it should:** every targeted variant gains +0.19 to +0.25 on held-out probes, and
   the target slice (problems with more than 4 steps) goes from 0.10 to 0.41-0.53; real data alone hurts the probes.

**What would address it (a decision for the team — not done):**
- (a) **Self-distillation for the solution text:** keep the problems, answers and features made by code, but train on
  the base model's own correct, verified solutions (rejection sampling: generate, keep only answers that match the
  gold and whose equations check out) instead of the terse reference text. This keeps the model's style. The
  solution text is then model-written, so it needs the team's explicit OK (PLAN.md §2.3, D2).
- (b) Make the code-written solutions longer and closer to the model's own style (stays fully "made by code"; may
  only partly help, since the real GSM8K solutions would still be terse).
- (c) Accept it: all arms share the regression, so arm-vs-arm comparisons stay fair — but a paper that lowers GSM8K
  accuracy is weaker, and reviewers will ask.
- Among the tested settings, ratio 1 regressed least and moved the target slice most, but the differences are within
  noise; no config was changed.

## 11. Self-distilled solution texts (option a, PLAN.md D14) — GPU-verified, EXPLORE (not paper evidence), 2026-10-06
```powershell
$env:HF_HUB_OFFLINE = "1"; $env:HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE = "1"
python -m dreammachine.experiments.tune --config configs/tune_distill.yaml
```
Qwen3-0.6B, same dev set (200 GSM8K-train problems held out), 100 held-out probes and B8 diagnosis as §10; one seed.
Both variants: targeted arm, ratio 3, **100k-token budget**, lr 2e-4, 2 epochs, max_seq_len 768. The only difference is
the solution text. Distillation (`dreammachine/data/distill.py`): 2 samples per item, temperature 0.7, top-p 0.8,
512 new tokens, qwen_boxed prompt; a sample is kept only if its final answer equals the code-made gold answer, it
writes at least one equation, every equation is correct, and it was not cut off; otherwise the original text stays.
Output: `runs/tuning/qwen06_distill/` (`summary.md`, `results/`, the arm's `.original.jsonl` / `.distill.json`).

**Distillation:** 768 of 1,037 rows distilled before the budget was full (stops early), 58 min. Accepted 381/768 =
50% (synthetic 270/588 = 46%, real 111/180 = 62%). Final arm: 705 items, of which 352 have model-written text =
**65% of the tokens** (synthetic 251 of 540 items, real 101 of 165). The rest keep the terse original text.

| Variant (100k tokens) | GSM8K dev (base 0.705) | Δ vs base [95% CI] | held-out probes (base 0.31) | Δ probes [95% CI] | target slice above (base 0.10) | answer length (base 748) | train |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **distilled** | **0.590** | **−0.115 [−0.180, −0.050]** | 0.41 | +0.10 [+0.02, +0.19] | 0.27 | 599 chars | 10 min |
| undistilled (control) | 0.465 | −0.240 [−0.315, −0.170] | 0.57 | +0.26 [+0.15, +0.37] | 0.49 | 307 chars | 14 min |

**Findings**
1. **Distillation halves the GSM8K regression** (−0.24 → −0.115) but does not remove it: the CI is still below 0.
   Answers stay longer (599 vs 307 chars), confirming that style is the cause.
2. **It also halves the targeted gain:** probes +0.26 → +0.10, target slice 0.49 → 0.27.
3. Likely reason for both: **selection bias of rejection sampling.** Only items the model can already solve get a
   model-written solution; 54% of the synthetic items — the hardest, i.e. the targeted ones — keep the terse code text.
   So the model learns its own style from easy items and the terse style from the hard ones, and the hard items carry
   less of the training signal. 35% of the tokens are still terse.
4. The 100k-token undistilled control matches the 200k §10 result (−0.24 / +0.26), so halving the budget changes
   nothing for the undistilled arm.

**Options (team decision — nothing changed in the paper configs):**
- (a2) More samples for the hard items (e.g. 4-8): raises acceptance on hard synthetic items; distilling costs ~2-4x.
- (a3) "Rationalisation" (STaR): for items the model fails, show it the gold answer and ask for a solution; still
  checked equation by equation. More model-written text — needs an explicit OK.
- (b) Code-written solutions in a longer, model-like style (stays fully D2): every item gets the same style,
  no selection bias; may lose some of the model's own phrasing.
- (c) Accept the regression (all arms share it).

## 12. Longer code-written solutions (option b) — GPU-verified, EXPLORE (not paper evidence), 2026-10-06
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.experiments.tune --config configs/tune_style.yaml
```
Same setup as §11 (Qwen3-0.6B, targeted arm, ratio 3, 100k tokens, max_seq_len 768, one seed; same output folder, so
`runs/tuning/qwen06_distill/summary.md` holds all three). `data.solution_style: steps` (`dreammachine/data/style.py`)
rewrites every training solution, real and synthetic, by code: "Let's solve this step by step." / "We need to find:
<question>" / one `**Step k: <quoted problem sentence>**` + the original line per step / "So the answer is n." /
`#### n`. Equations and answers unchanged. Training solutions ~545 chars (before: synthetic 167, GSM8K 257).

| Variant (100k tokens) | GSM8K dev (base 0.705) | Δ vs base [95% CI] | dev answers cut off at 512 tokens (base 0.02) | held-out probes (base 0.31) | target slice (base 0.10) | answer length |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| distilled (§11) | 0.590 | −0.115 [−0.180, −0.050] | 0.07 | 0.41 (+0.10) | 0.27 | 599 |
| undistilled (§11) | 0.465 | −0.240 [−0.315, −0.170] | 0.035 | 0.57 (+0.26) | 0.49 | 307 |
| **steps style** | **0.425** | **−0.280 [−0.360, −0.200]** | **0.185** | 0.50 (+0.19) | 0.39 | 728 |

**Findings**
1. **Option b in this form is worse than the terse control** on GSM8K dev (CIs overlap: not clearly worse, but
   clearly not better), and keeps most of the probe gain.
2. **Cause: the rigid template makes the 0.6B model loop.** 18.5% of dev answers run into the 512-token limit (base
   2%). Inspected on the GPU (9 of the first 32 wrong dev answers were cut off): the model repeats
   `**Step k: <same sentence>**` + the same equation until the limit, or forces a GSM8K problem into the
   quote-then-compute pattern (e.g. "Oliver has 40 + 200 = 240 quarters" for "$40 and 200 quarters").
3. **Length is not what matters; the model's own reasoning is.** The steps style is as long as the base model's
   answers (728 vs 748 chars) yet regresses most; the only variant that reduced the regression is the one whose
   text the model wrote itself (§11).

The code stays (`solution_style` defaults to `terse`, so all other data is unchanged), but this style is not
recommended. Remaining options: more samples / rationalisation for distillation (a2/a3, needs an explicit OK for
more model-written text), or accept the regression (c).

## 13. Self-distillation with more tries (option a2) — GPU-verified, EXPLORE (not paper evidence), 2026-10-06
```powershell
python -m dreammachine.experiments.tune --config configs/tune_distill8.yaml
```
Same setup as §11; every item gets 2 answers, an item with none accepted gets 6 more (other seed): up to 8 tries.
Distillation took 137 min (704 rows until the budget was full). Accepted 531/704 = 75% (synthetic 392/536 = 73%,
was 46% with 2 tries; real 139/168 = 83%); 179 of the 352 retried items were rescued by the retry. Final arm: 605
items, **85% of the tokens model-written** (§11: 65%).

| Variant (100k tokens) | items | model-written tokens | GSM8K dev (base 0.705) | Δ vs base [95% CI] | held-out probes (base 0.31) | Δ probes [95% CI] | target slice (base 0.10) | answer length |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| undistilled (§11) | 1037 | 0% | 0.465 | −0.240 [−0.315, −0.170] | 0.57 | +0.26 [+0.15, +0.37] | 0.49 | 307 |
| steps style (§12) | 612 | 0% | 0.425 | −0.280 [−0.360, −0.200] | 0.50 | +0.19 [+0.08, +0.30] | 0.39 | 728 |
| distilled, 2 tries (§11) | 705 | 65% | 0.590 | −0.115 [−0.180, −0.050] | 0.41 | +0.10 [+0.02, +0.19] | 0.27 | 599 |
| **distilled, up to 8 tries** | 605 | 85% | **0.625** | **−0.080 [−0.145, −0.015]** | 0.39 | +0.08 [−0.01, +0.17] | 0.16 | 718 |

**Findings**
1. **More model-written text → less GSM8K loss, but also less targeted gain.** It is a clear trade-off across the
   three text variants: 0% / 65% / 85% model-written tokens give −0.24 / −0.115 / −0.08 on GSM8K dev and +0.26 /
   +0.10 / +0.08 on the probes (target slice 0.49 / 0.27 / 0.16). At 85% the probe gain is no longer significant.
2. **Why the gain shrinks** (two causes, not separated by this test):
   - training on answers the model already gets right teaches it little new — the targeted gain came from imitating
     the code-written solutions of problems it could *not* solve;
   - at an equal token budget, longer solutions mean fewer problems: 605 vs 1037 items.
3. Part of the undistilled probe gain may be learning the probe problems' *format* (they are code-generated like the
   training data), not only the skill; the GSM8K regression and the probe gain come from the same imitation.
4. No variant removes the regression: the smallest is still −0.08 with the CI below 0 (one seed, 200 problems).

**Recommendation (team decision; no paper config changed):** keep the code-written (terse) solutions for the paper
runs — D2 stays fully intact and the targeting signal is largest, which is what the paper compares (targeted vs
matched_control, both trained the same way, so the shared GSM8K cost does not bias that comparison). Report the
GSM8K regression as a stated cost, with this dev study (§10-13) as the evidence that it comes from the solution style
and that self-distillation trades it against the targeted gain. Self-distillation can be reported as an ablation.

## 14. Paper run, Qwen3-0.6B — GPU-verified, PAPER, paper-eligible, 2026-10-07/09
Job `80b37628b193` (commit `ebfb143`, clean tree; baseline + diagnosis reused from `04f319d1cca7`, PLAN.md D16).
Protocol `configs/main.yaml` (D15): 5 arm keys × 3 seeds, 600k tokens each; every trained model evaluated on GSM8K
300 + GSM-Symbolic main 200 + probes 135 + 135. Target: `steps` > 4 (diagnosis). Full tables:
`runs/pipelines/80b37628b193/report.md` and `results.json`.
**Timing:** training 1.41 h, evaluation 26 min on average; the worker was stopped once by a low-memory event
(2026-10-08 ~02:30, ~9 h idle) and resumed from the last checkpoint.

Baseline (untrained): GSM8K 0.638 (n 1319), GSM-Symbolic main 0.570 (500), probes train-families 0.384,
held-out families 0.324 (432 each).

| Arm (mean of 3 seeds) | GSM8K | GSM-Symbolic | probes train fam. | probes held-out fam. | held-out slice > 4 steps (base 0.18) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| real_only | 0.458 (−0.20) | 0.415 (−0.16) | 0.237 (−0.13) | 0.247 (−0.10) | 0.09 |
| untargeted 3:1 | 0.447 (−0.21) | 0.418 (−0.16) | 0.941 (+0.58) | 0.760 (+0.41) | 0.71 |
| matched_control 3:1 | 0.448 (−0.21) | 0.408 (−0.17) | 0.881 (+0.52) | 0.760 (+0.41) | 0.65 |
| targeted 3:1 | 0.436 (−0.22) | 0.407 (−0.17) | 0.795 (+0.43) | 0.602 (+0.25) | 0.54 |
| targeted 9:1 | 0.422 (−0.24) | 0.382 (−0.19) | 0.869 (+0.51) | 0.704 (+0.36) | 0.66 |

(Δ vs the untrained model on the same problems; every GSM8K / GSM-Symbolic Δ has its 95% CI below 0.)

**Headline (D8), targeted − matched_control at 3:1:** GSM8K −0.012 [−0.039, +0.014], p 0.39; GSM-Symbolic
−0.002 [−0.037, +0.032], p 0.93. **No difference.**

**Findings**
1. **No targeting benefit on real problems.** Targeted and matched control are equal on GSM8K and GSM-Symbolic
   (and equal to untargeted). All trained arms lose ~0.16-0.24 there — the known solution-style cost (§10-13).
2. **On the generated probes, targeted is *worse* than matched control and untargeted** (held-out families: −0.16
   vs both, CI below 0), **even on the targeted slice** (problems with > 4 steps: 0.54 vs 0.65 / 0.71).
3. **But targeting did shrink the targeted weakness most:** the `steps` effect (η) fell by 0.98 for targeted 3:1
   and 0.72 for 9:1, vs +0.05 (untargeted) and +0.23 (matched). The other arms instead fixed multiplication and
   division much more (η change −0.9 to −1.8 vs −0.01 / −0.14 for targeted 3:1). Long problems also contain
   multiplications and divisions, so broad data helped them more in absolute accuracy.
4. More synthetic data helps the targeted arm on probes (9:1 > 3:1 on every probe measure) and costs a little more
   on GSM8K (−0.036 vs real_only at 9:1, p 0.054).
5. real_only training lowers every measure, probes included.
Interpretation for the paper is the team's (open question 10 in PLAN.md).

**Qwen3-1.7B paper run (job `409305f3e2f2`, running):** measured so far: baseline 67 min, diagnosis 120 min,
training ~1.5 h, evaluation ~17 min. On 2026-10-09 08:18 `train:matched_control_r3_s0` stopped with a CUDA
out-of-memory error at step 100/846 caused by **memory fragmentation** (1.03 GiB requested; 1.36 GiB reserved but
split into smaller blocks). Resumed with the worker started under
`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=max_split_size_mb:256,garbage_collection_threshold:0.8` (PyTorch allocator settings only:
no change to the protocol, data or maths); it passed step 200 normally. Start the paper worker this way from now on:
